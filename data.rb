  # In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects
  # providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

  # "String"
  #----------#
  # A string is any finite sequence of characters (i.e., letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation marks).
  # Strings are wrapped in quotes: "String"
  # Strings can be stores in variables. Below is a type of variable called a CONSTANT.
  # I think this string MINASWAN should be a default CONSTANT.
  # MINASWAN is a Ruby programming motto designed to promote positivity and goodwill among community members.
